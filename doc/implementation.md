# Implementation

## Spring Boot

We used the spring framework to implement one of our APIs from a Java SE project.

We also used CrudRepository (and subclasses) to communicate with our databases.

## Swagger

We use swagger to generate our servers from the API specs (.yaml).

## Traefik

We use traefik to automatically reverse proxy our two endpoints.
