# testing Strategy

## Cucumber



## Jmeter

We used Jmeter to load and performance test our app.

### Opinion

With more time and more expertise we could have been able to do more about our current tests. However, as it stands right now our tests can only be called satisfactory in that they are used to test a minimalist application.

This is not to say that our tests are bad but for larger and longer projects we would need a better testing range perhaps even some form of test automation using tools like **travis** or having more tests that test the interaction between classes and between servlets.
