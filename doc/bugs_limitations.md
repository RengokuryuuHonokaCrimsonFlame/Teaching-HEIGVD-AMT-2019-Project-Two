# Bugs, Limitations and Improvements

## Bugs

There were no obvious bugs found.

## Limitations

There are no real limitations when it comes to the usage of the APIs. The only limitations that could be found are those due to the program's limited features.

## Improvements

Many of the improvements that could be made to the application side and are ostensibly the same as in project one even if what we have is sufficient to implement our APIs.
